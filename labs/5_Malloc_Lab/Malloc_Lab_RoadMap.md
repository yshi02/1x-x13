# Malloc Lab RoadMap

Hey all!



Malloc lab is quite long, and can be intimidating! If you're a little lost on where to start, attached is a roadmap which suggests a structured way of tackling the lab. This is for purely informational purposes; you will not be graded on your adherence to the roadmap. We hope that this helps guide your thinking and makes it less overwhelming. As always, feel free to ask questions on piazza as well as make reservations with your small group TAs or attend office hours.



Good luck and you got this! :)
