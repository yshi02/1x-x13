## Office Hour Etiquette

Please remember that when you are signing up for OH:

1. **DO NOT** book consecutive appointments until your first appointment is finished. **This policy explicitly exists and there will be consequences if there are such violations.**

2. **DO NOT** enter waiting rooms without booking an appointment. the TA will probably not let you in.

3. **please please please but DESCRIPTIONS** in your appointment booking slot because it helps the TAs out!

4. You should be able to book your appointments some time in the morning of the respective day and should be able to book appointments up until the desired time of the appointment.

5. Don't be shy! We are here to help!
