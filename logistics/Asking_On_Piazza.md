# Asking on Piazza

We realize that you may have a lot of questions during this semester and we are willing to help you at any time. But for saving time from both of us, please read these before you have your posts.

+ **Other students may have asked similar questions before.** Read existing posts before you have your own posts and try not to ask duplicated questions, or otherwise, both TAs and students will be overwhelmed and that's disappointing. For similar questions, we recommend you have your questions under the FollowUp part instead of creating a new post.

+ **No code is allowed publicly.** If you need to share your code with instructors, you must send it in a private post. Publicly, you are only allowed to have high-level ideas without any implementation details.

+ **Code and ideas from textbooks and materials that are explicitly given by us (including handouts, recitations, slides) are always safe.** You don't need to worry about AIV when looking at these materials. But for other references, you MUST have it commented if you read some articles. And NO copy-paste allowed for direct solutions.

+ **An anonymous post is not a private post.** Some of you mistook a private post for an anonymous post, which *makes some duplicated questions, and a delay in response*.

+ When you choose to post anonymously, other students will see you as “Anon.”, *you don’t need to ask us for posting you anonymously* - you can choose it yourself. Also, you can answer questions anonymously.

+ Private posts can only be seen by you and instructors: For *individual issues* (when you need to provide your name, Andrew ID, or those only works for you), or *code-related* posts (which is not allowed to discuss publicly), please send private posts (which will be seen only by instructors).

+ Otherwise, please send public posts so that other students can *also learn something* from the same issue, and they may help you get answers *more quickly* because they may *meet the same bug* as you ask (For example, you can ask what should we pay attention to in test case 3, and someone may answer that you should be careful when you deal with an empty list, which will help not only you but also others, so we encourage public posts here). Note that you can always choose to be anonymous when you post public posts as you wish.



**We encourage you, students, to discuss and have the answer yourselves which is really meaningful than having answers from TAs.** Just share your ideas in the posts, and try to figure out the answers together with your classmates. We may not give you the correct answer immediately and instead, we may wait for some time and pick the correct student answers (no worries, we will still give you the answer if no one finds it out, and we will add some missing parts in students answer to give you a full inspection).
